In this project we plan to calculate the operation point voltage of series of red, green, yellow and RG LEDs by an Arduino based system. The output voltage of the connected LEDs to Arduino-UNO will be shown in serial monitor. The following formula is used to select the correct resistor for a LED:

Where Vs is the source voltage, V(LED) is LED forward voltage, I(LED) is LED forward current and X is Number of LEDs to be connected in series. According to the above formula, the desired resistors of a red LED with the forward voltage of 1.8V, source voltage 5V and current of 20mA is a 220â„¦ one. We also calculated this issue for LEDs with other colors, which you can see in the following table.
