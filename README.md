LED Configuration System
LEDs have a strict need for the right voltage and the right current. In order to accomplish that, the correct series of resistors has to be selected by calculation. Assume a set of different LEDs, all working with a forward current of around 20mA. Your Arduino-based device should take on any LED and measure the operation point voltage. In the next steps, information about the LED, including recommendations for a series of resistors at different source voltages and other useful recommendations and values shall to be displayed.
