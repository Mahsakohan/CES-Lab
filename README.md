LEDs have a strict need for the right voltage and the right current. In the designed circuit, a series of LEDs with a forward current of around 20mA and the correct series of resistors are connected to the Arduino. This Arduino-based system calculates the operation point voltage of any LED. The system utilizes the output voltage and current from Arduino-uno to light up the connected LEDs. In the next steps, information about series of resistors at different source voltages will be be displayed.
